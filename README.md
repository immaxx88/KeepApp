Step 1 : Clone the repo by the command git clone https://github.com/immaxx88/KeepApp.git

I have used VS Code as a Code Editor feel free to use what you want

Step 2 : Drag and drop whole folder into the VSCode and navigate inside the directory of the project.

Step 3 : Now, install the node modules by the command->   npm install
                                                          ng serve 

The Angular deployment server will start at http://localhost:4200/
